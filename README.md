# Statistics-using-python
* This project deals with Exploratory Data analysis on housing prices.
* The dataset used in a csv file which contains infromation about house prices and various attributes of a house. 
# Introduction :
* Exploratory data analysis is the process of performing initial investigation on data in order to discover trends, patterns, data anamolies, test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of statistical tests and visualizations/graphical representations.
* The fundamental questions that are answered using EDA are 
1. What has happpend , how and why it happend ?
2. What could happen in future ? 

# Objective :
* Objective of this project is to find factors affecting house prices and to find trends. 
* It demonstrates how various variables affect the price of a houses .

# Observations : 
1. As we plot Sale Prices, it is evident that the plot is extremely right skewed. This suggests that the most of the house prices are concentrated around the mean that is 180921.19

3. Overall condition is the score given to a perticular house based on the considering all factors. There seems to be an interesting trend emerging. As OverallCondition score increases the price of a house descreases.
